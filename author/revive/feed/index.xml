In a year, it is estimated that we have sold 30,000 items of clothing, 49,000 books and 100,000 of Bric-à-brac items.</p>
<p>Based on statistics from the Furniture Re-use Network, an organisation that oversees re-use businesses; the impact on our local community is that 3,500 households have saved an estimated half a million pounds y reusing rather than buying new.</p>
<p>It is also estimated that we have diverted a quarter of a million kilograms worth of items from landfill.</p>
<p>We at Revive would like to thank our customers; as none of this would have been possible without them.</p>
